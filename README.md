## üõ† Prerequisites

To compile and execute the programs, ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system. Common options include:

- **GCC**: Install via `gcc` on Linux/Mac or using [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) on Windows.
- **Turbo C++**: A classic IDE for C programming.
- **Dev-C++**: Lightweight and easy-to-use.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

These programs were written and tested in a **Windows environment**. The `#include <Windows.h>` header file is used in some programs, particularly for the `Sleep()` function. If you are using a different operating system, you may encounter compatibility issues. In such cases, replace `Sleep(milliseconds)` with an equivalent function, such as `usleep(milliseconds * 1000)` (on POSIX systems) or remove it if not essential.
